Advanced Thing: Complex Behavior (#2)
Example: Drive/Follow Vertibird-1
Vertibird-1 demonstrates how a vertibird rotates its wings, takes off, and flys in this behavior. It takes off, fly around the scene and patrols around.

Advanced Thing: Complex Behavior (#2)
Example: Drive/Follow Vertibird-2

Advanced Thing: Complex Object (#3)
Example: The Prydwen

Advanced Thing: Complex Object (#3)
Example: Vertibird

Advanced Thing: Complex Object (#3)
Example: Brotherhood of Steel Soldier

Advanced Thing: Dynamic Environment Map (#17)
Example: Lookat Billboard
The billboard reflects the surroundings/scene, which makes it look like a camera screen
