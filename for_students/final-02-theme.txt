My town's theme is the army of Brotherhood Of Steel from Fallout 4 in an airport. The game series Fallout is based on a post-apocalyptic world, and Brotherhood of Steel is a military which has access to high level technology. The technology they have contains The Prydwen (the massive airship homebase), Vertibirds (the aircraft that can change flying mode), Power Armors (armors using nuclear fusion power, providing impenetrable defense and powerful attack), Liberty Prime (the massive war robot). In the game Fallout 4, the player first sees The Prydwen airship in Boston Airport, and I tried to create an airport under the control of the Brotherhood of Steel.
